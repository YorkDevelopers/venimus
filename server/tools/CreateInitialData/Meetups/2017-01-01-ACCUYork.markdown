ACCU York is a local group of the [ACCU][accu-site], meeting most months to discuss a wide range of topics relating to software development.

What is ACCU? No longer an acronym, ACCU stands for professionalism in programming. We promote self-improvement for software practitioners. C++, Java, Agile, functional: whatever you're interested in, our members are too.

See ACCU on [Twitter][accu-york-twitter] and [Facebook][accu-york-facebook] for more information on when we meet.

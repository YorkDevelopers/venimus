York Game Developers.

This is a group for anyone developing computer games in York.  Bring a laptop and show off your latest creation, get advice, or just meet like-minded people once a month and have a beer.  If you write pixel shaders in your sleep, or rig an octoped before breakfast, this is the group for you!  Anyone welcome - be they programmers, artists, musicians, designers.  We're now living in a UNESCO City of Media Arts - it's an exciting time to be in York.  Lets find out who's working away on the next Mario 64 in their basement ;)

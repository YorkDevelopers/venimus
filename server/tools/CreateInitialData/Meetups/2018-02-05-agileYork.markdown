agileYork.

We are a group of Agile advocates who'd like to share and help others develop the values and principles of the Agile manifesto in themselves.

We welcome beginners and those already experimenting with this new way of working and wish to learn more.

Our vision is to help individuals and teams make their working lives better.  By improving the way they learn, share and communicate with others.

Visit our [agileYork Meetup][agile-york-meetup-link] for more information.

Front-End-York is the perfect MeetUp for anyone interested in Front End Web Development, Design and UX. From HTML to React, UI to interaction design; we're going to be discussing absolutely everything front end.

We're a friendly bunch and everyone is welcome - regardless if you're just starting out in the industry or have over a decade of experience, if you pop along we promise you won't be bored!

Fancy speaking at one of our MeetUps? Great! Get in touch with an organiser so we can pencil something in. Speakers of any experience welcome.
